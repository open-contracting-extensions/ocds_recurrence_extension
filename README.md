# Recurring contracts

This extension adds fields for information on the recurrence of the contracting process.

## Usage

This field should be used if, for example, another procurement procedure or qualification system for the same contract matter is likely to be re-launched, or re-established, in the foreseeable future. Note that this does not mean awarding multiple contracts within a single qualification system, framework agreement, or dynamic purchasing system. In these cases, the field should not be used.

This information can be useful, for example, to companies deciding whether to invest into machinery necessary for a particular contract. With this information, they know that there will likely be an opportunity to win similar contracts in future years, which may make the investment more worthwhile.¹

## Legal context

The [Revised Agreement on Government Procurement](https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/rev-gpr-94_01_e.htm) (GPA) includes: "each notice of intended procurement shall include … c. for recurring contracts, an estimate, if possible, of the timing of subsequent notices of intended procurement".

The European Union is a [party](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/memobs_e.htm) to the GPA, and as such its [Directive 2014/24/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.094.01.0065.01.ENG) (Public contracts — setting out clear ground rules) includes: "Part C: Information to be included in contract notices … 27. In the case of recurrent procurement, estimated timing for further notices to be published."
